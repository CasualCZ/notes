# 云原生

### 什么是云原生

#### CNCF定义

>Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
>
>These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

#### Pivotal定义

> Cloud native is an approach to building and running applications that exploits the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. Cloud native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where
>
> Organizations require a platform for building and operating cloud native applications and services that automates and integrates the concepts of DevOps, continuous delivery, microservices, and containers
